# connectrpc User Guide

This guide is the long-form companion to the
[crate README](../README.md). It covers installation, code generation,
server and client usage, streaming, tower middleware, TLS, error
handling, and compression. If you just want to try the library, start
with the [README quick start](../README.md#quick-start) and the
[`examples/`](../examples) directory.

## Installation

`connectrpc` ships as five crates:

| Crate | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `connectrpc` | Tower-based runtime: server dispatcher, client transports, codec, compression |
| `protoc-gen-connect-rust` (binary, in `connectrpc-codegen`) | `protoc` plugin that generates service stubs |
| `connectrpc-build` | `build.rs` integration that runs the codegen at build time |
| `connectrpc-health` | The standard `grpc.health.v1.Health` service for liveness / readiness probes ([Health checking](#health-checking)) |
| `connectrpc-reflection` | The standard gRPC server reflection service (`grpc.reflection.v1` + `v1alpha`) for `grpcurl` / `buf curl` / Postman / `grpcui` ([Server reflection](#server-reflection)) |

Generated code references a small set of crates from your namespace, so
a working `Cargo.toml` needs more than the runtime itself — this is the
complete dependency block for a typical (JSON-capable) service:

```toml
[dependencies]
connectrpc = "0.8"
buffa = { version = "0.9", features = ["json"] }
buffa-types = { version = "0.9", features = ["json"] }
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1"

[build-dependencies]
connectrpc-build = "0.8"
```

The `buffa`/`serde` entries come from buffa's generated message types.
For proto-only builds (no JSON), drop the `json` features and
`serde`/`serde_json` — see
[Generated Code Dependencies](../README.md#generated-code-dependencies)
in the README.

### MSRV

The MSRV is **Rust 1.88**, declared on the workspace and verified in
CI. The crate uses Rust 2024 edition.

### Feature flags

The runtime is feature-gated so you only pay for what you use:

| Feature | Default | What it adds |
|---|---|---|
| `json` | yes | JSON codec for protobuf messages (the proto3-JSON wire format). Disabling it drops the `serde` requirement on message types — see [Proto-only builds](#proto-only-no-json-builds) |
| `gzip` | yes | Gzip compression via `flate2` |
| `zstd` | yes | Zstandard compression via `zstd` |
| `streaming` | yes | Streaming compression via `async-compression` |
| `client` | no | HTTP client transports (cleartext) |
| `client-tls` | no | TLS for client transports |
| `server` | no | Built-in hyper server (`Server`) |
| `server-tls` | no | TLS for the built-in server |
| `tls` | no | Convenience alias for both `server-tls` + `client-tls` |
| `axum` | no | Axum integration (`Router::into_axum_service`, `Router::into_axum_router`) |

Common combinations:

```toml
# Just the server, behind axum
connectrpc = { version = "0.8", features = ["axum"] }

# Server + client, both with TLS
connectrpc = { version = "0.8", features = ["axum", "client", "tls"] }

# Built-in server (no axum)
connectrpc = { version = "0.8", features = ["server"] }

# Minimal (wasm-friendly: no networking, no native compression)
connectrpc = { version = "0.8", default-features = false }
```

### Proto-only (no-JSON) builds

The Connect protocol supports two message codecs: binary proto and proto3
JSON. The JSON codec needs every message type to be `serde::Serialize` /
`Deserialize`, which is why the code generator derives those impls by default.
A deployment that only ever speaks binary proto can turn JSON off and shed
those derives — smaller generated code, no `serde_derive` in the message-type
build.

It takes two coordinated settings:

1. **Generate without serde derives.** Pass the `no_json` plugin option (or
   `connectrpc-build`'s [`.generate_json(false)`](#connectrpc-build-build-time-simplest)),
   so message structs are emitted without `#[derive(serde::Serialize,
   serde::Deserialize)]`.
2. **Disable the runtime `json` feature**, which relaxes the message-type
   bounds from `Message + Serialize`/`DeserializeOwned` to just `Message`:

   ```toml
   # Proto-only server: no JSON codec, no serde on message types.
   # `default-features = false` is the only way to drop `json`, so it also drops
   # the default compression features (`gzip`/`zstd`/`streaming`) — re-list the
   # ones you still want.
   connectrpc = { version = "0.8", default-features = false, features = ["server", "gzip", "zstd", "streaming"] }
   ```

With `json` off, the `Message + serde` requirement is replaced by the
`JsonSerialize` / `JsonDeserialize` marker traits, which become empty bounds —
so a serde-free generated type still satisfies every handler, router, and
client signature.

A proto-only server **rejects JSON at content negotiation**, before it touches
the request body: `application/json` and `application/connect+json` (and the
Connect GET `encoding=json` parameter) are unsupported media types, so the
server responds with a bodyless **HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type** (the client
maps the status to an error code); `application/grpc+json` and
`application/grpc-web+json` get a gRPC error status. Message-level encode/decode
also returns `Unimplemented` as a defense-in-depth backstop. Handler-level
errors (and the streaming end-of-stream frame) remain JSON, as the Connect spec
requires regardless of the request codec. On the client side, the
`ClientConfig::json` shorthand is removed from the API in a proto-only build, so
JSON cannot be selected by mistake.

`connectrpc` itself still depends on `serde` and `serde_json` even in a
proto-only build — the always-JSON error wire format needs them — so they stay
in `cargo tree`. What proto-only mode removes is the serde *derive* on your
generated message types and the per-message JSON (de)serialization paths.

Because `json` is an additive, default-on Cargo feature, it is only truly off
when *every* crate in your dependency graph that depends on `connectrpc`
disables it. If any other crate pulls in `connectrpc` with `json` enabled,
feature unification turns it back on for the whole build, the markers revert to
`Serialize`/`DeserializeOwned`, and your serde-free generated types stop
compiling (`Serialize is not satisfied` — note the error names the trait, not
the feature). Proto-only mode therefore fits a leaf binary or a fully
proto-only graph, not one library inside a mixed workspace.

> View-body responses are already proto-only and return `Unimplemented` for the
> JSON codec — see [Returning a view body](#returning-a-view-body) — so a
> proto-only build changes nothing for them.

## Quick start

Define a service:

```protobuf
// proto/greet.proto
syntax = "proto3";
package greet.v1;

service GreetService {
  rpc Greet(GreetRequest) returns (GreetResponse);
}

message GreetRequest { string name = 1; }
message GreetResponse { string greeting = 1; }
```

Generate code with `connectrpc-build` in `build.rs`:

```toml
[build-dependencies]
connectrpc-build = "0.8"
```

```rust
// build.rs
fn main() {
    connectrpc_build::Config::new()
        .files(&["proto/greet.proto"])
        .includes(&["proto/"])
        .include_file("_connectrpc.rs")
        .compile()
        .unwrap();
}
```

Implement the service:

```rust
// src/main.rs
use std::sync::Arc;
use connectrpc::{RequestContext, Response, Router, ServiceRequest, ServiceResult};

pub mod proto {
    connectrpc::include_generated!();
}
use proto::greet::v1::*;

struct MyGreet;

impl GreetService for MyGreet {
    async fn greet(
        &self,
        _ctx: RequestContext,
        req: ServiceRequest<'_, GreetRequest>,
    ) -> ServiceResult<GreetResponse> {
        Response::ok(GreetResponse {
            greeting: format!("Hello, {}!", req.name),
            ..Default::default()
        })
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>> {
    let router = Router::new().add_service(Arc::new(MyGreet));
    let app = router.into_axum_router();

    let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:8080").await?;
    axum::serve(listener, app).await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

That's the full server. Make a request with curl to confirm it works:

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/greet.v1.GreetService/Greet \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name": "World"}'
```

For runnable end-to-end examples, see the
[`examples/`](../examples) directory.

## Code generation

Two workflows are supported. Both produce the same runtime API.

### `connectrpc-build` (build-time, simplest)

Used in `build.rs`. Compiles `.proto` files at build time, regenerates
on change, no extra binaries needed.

```rust
// build.rs
fn main() {
    connectrpc_build::Config::new()
        .files(&["proto/greet.proto", "proto/billing.proto"])
        .includes(&["proto/"])
        .include_file("_connectrpc.rs")
        .compile()
        .unwrap();
}
```

Output is unified: message types and service stubs in one file per
proto, included into your crate with `connectrpc::include_generated!()`.
Best for simple projects.

If you need the compiled `FileDescriptorSet` at runtime — most commonly
to feed the [`connectrpc-reflection`](#server-reflection) crate — chain
`.emit_descriptor_set("svc_descriptor.bin")` before `.compile()`. The
name must be a bare file name (no path separators). The set (including
the full transitive import closure) is written to `OUT_DIR` and can be
embedded with
`include_bytes!(concat!(env!("OUT_DIR"), "/svc_descriptor.bin"))`. See
the `Config::emit_descriptor_set` rustdoc for details.

### `buf generate` (checked-in code, production-grade)

Recommended when you want generated code committed to the repo,
multi-output structure (e.g. separate proto modules from service
modules), or when generating across language boundaries from one
schema. Requires three plugins: `protoc-gen-buffa` for message types,
`protoc-gen-connect-rust` for service stubs, and
`protoc-gen-buffa-packaging` for assembling `mod.rs` trees.

`protoc-gen-buffa` owns `<stem>.rs` and its ancillary companion files
(`<stem>.__view.rs`, `<stem>.__oneof.rs`, …); `protoc-gen-connect-rust`
adds `<stem>.__connect.rs` containing the service trait + client. Each
package gets a `<pkg>.mod.rs` stitcher that `include!`s all of them.

If you'd rather have one file per proto package — the convention that
[Buf Schema Registry] cargo SDK generation and [`tonic`]-style build
integrations expect — pass `opt: file_per_package` to **both**
`protoc-gen-buffa` and `protoc-gen-connect-rust`. That collapses each
plugin's output to one `<dotted.pkg>.rs` per package with everything
inlined and no per-file companion files or `<pkg>.mod.rs` stitcher.
Drop the `protoc-gen-buffa-packaging` invocations under this layout —
there is nothing for them to wire — and either let your downstream tool
synthesise the module tree from `<dotted.package>.rs` filenames (BSR
cargo SDKs do this automatically) or hand-write the `mod.rs`. Keep
routing each plugin to its own `out:` directory; the filename is shared
between them and would silently overwrite in a shared one.
`connectrpc-build` users get the same option as
`Config::file_per_package(true)`, which inlines the service stubs into
buffa's `<dotted.pkg>.rs` and is otherwise transparent — the include
file picks up the new filename automatically.

See the README's
[Code generation section](../README.md#generate-rust-code) for plugin
installation, `buf.gen.yaml` configuration, and the `buffa_module`
shorthand for cross-tree references.

[`tonic`]: https://docs.rs/tonic-build/latest/tonic_build/

### Inclusion patterns side-by-side

Both workflows produce the same runtime API. The only difference is how
you include the generated code into your crate:

```rust
// connectrpc-build (build.rs) users:
pub mod proto { connectrpc::include_generated!(); }

// buf generate users:
#[path = "generated/proto/mod.rs"]
pub mod proto;
```

The underlying difference (`OUT_DIR` vs a known source path) is honest
and visible, but the call-site shape is parallel.

### Very large schemas

Generation reads a descriptor set, and buffa bounds how much memory a
decode may commit to repeated elements. That bound is an amplification
defence sized for untrusted wire input, and it is charged on each
element's struct size rather than on its encoded bytes — so descriptor
sets, whose structs are wide, reach it while still looking small on the
wire. The tooling paths — this plugin and `connectrpc-build` — therefore
decode under buffa's much higher tooling bound of 1 GiB. It stays finite,
so a truncated or corrupt set still fails with an error instead of
exhausting memory.

If you do exceed it, generation stops with a message naming the budget in
force and both ways to raise it. Both accept a byte count or `unlimited`,
and they differ in reach.

**The environment variable covers the whole run**, which is normally what
you want:

```sh
BUFFA_ELEMENT_MEMORY_LIMIT=4294967296 buf generate
BUFFA_ELEMENT_MEMORY_LIMIT=4294967296 cargo build
```

`buf generate` hands the identical request to every plugin in the run, so
a schema big enough to need raising needs it for `protoc-gen-buffa` and
`protoc-gen-connect-rust` alike. The variable is buffa's rather than a
connect-specific twin precisely so that one setting serves both. It is
also the only override that reaches `connectrpc-build`, since a build
script has no plugin parameter string.

**The plugin option is per-plugin.** `buf` gives each plugin its own `opt`
list, so this raises the bound for `protoc-gen-connect-rust` and nothing
else — every other plugin in the run needs its own entry:

```yaml
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-buffa
    out: src/generated
    opt:
      - element_memory_limit=4294967296
  - local: protoc-gen-connect-rust
    out: src/generated
    opt:
      - element_memory_limit=4294967296
```

Prefer a byte count to `unlimited`. `unlimited` removes the ceiling
entirely, so a truncated or corrupt descriptor set stops failing with an
error and starts exhausting memory instead — on CI that reads as a flaky
runner rather than a bad input. A generous number keeps the diagnostic.

This bound governs *generation* only, and nothing here reaches a running
server. A descriptor set handed to a `Reflector` decodes on buffa's
untrusted-input default with no override: reflection descriptors can come
from a peer rather than your own build, so the defence stays on. A set
over that budget reports `ReflectionError::ElementBudget`, and the remedy
is a smaller set — strip `source_code_info`, or narrow it to the files
that server reflects.

Request decoding is a different budget again, configured per service
through `Limits::element_memory_limit`. None of the three read each
other, so raising the build-time bound has no effect on either.

## Implementing servers

A service is a Rust trait generated from your `.proto` file. The
trait name matches the proto service name (`GreetService` becomes
`trait GreetService`), and each RPC becomes an async method.

### Handler signatures

Unary handlers take a read-only `RequestContext` plus a borrowed
`ServiceRequest<'_, RequestType>`, and return
`ServiceResult<ResponseType>`:

```rust
impl GreetService for MyGreet {
    async fn greet(
        &self,
        _ctx: RequestContext,
        req: ServiceRequest<'_, GreetRequest>,
    ) -> ServiceResult<GreetResponse> {
        // req derefs to the request view: zero-copy field access.
        // String fields are &str borrowed from the request buffer.
        Response::ok(GreetResponse {
            greeting: format!("Hello, {}!", req.name),
            ..Default::default()
        })
    }
}
```

The `ServiceRequest` shape lets handlers read string fields without
allocating - `req.name` is a `&str` directly into the request bytes,
and the borrow may be held across `.await` points. The request is
borrowed from the dispatcher-owned body, so the response (and anything
moved into `tokio::spawn`) cannot borrow from it - call
`.to_owned_message()` to get the owned struct when you need one. The
conversion is infallible: buffa charges every unknown-field record
against the decode-time allowance, so a request that
decoded successfully always re-materializes.

### `RequestContext` and `Response`

Request-side metadata lives on `RequestContext` (passed in);
response-side metadata lives on `Response<B>` (returned):

`RequestContext` is `#[non_exhaustive]`; read it through the accessor
methods (new request-scoped metadata can then be added in minor releases):

| `RequestContext` accessor | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ctx.header(name)` / `ctx.headers()` | Caller-supplied headers (after protocol-prefix stripping) |
| `ctx.deadline()` | Absolute `Instant` if the caller set a timeout |
| `ctx.time_remaining()` | Saturating `Option<Duration>` until the deadline (`None` when no deadline is set) — budget downstream calls with this |
| `ctx.extensions()` | `http::Extensions` carried from the underlying `http::Request` |
| `ctx.path()` | Requested procedure path (`/package.Service/Method`) from the request URI |
| `ctx.spec()` | Static metadata for the dispatched RPC method ([`Spec`](#static-method-metadata-spec)); `None` only for low-level manual registrations that do not attach one |
| `ctx.protocol()` | The negotiated wire protocol for this request (`Connect` / `Grpc` / `GrpcWeb`) |
| `ctx.peer_addr()` | Remote socket address (requires the `server` feature; `None` when the transport didn't insert it) |
| `ctx.peer_certs()` | TLS client cert chain (requires the `server-tls` feature; `None` for plaintext or no client cert) |

For example, propagating the caller's deadline to a downstream RPC and
reading the peer cert chain:

```rust,ignore
// Budget downstream calls from the remaining time, leaving a margin
// for response encoding and network round-trips.
if let Some(remaining) = ctx.time_remaining() {
    let budget = remaining.saturating_sub(Duration::from_millis(50));
    options = options.with_timeout(budget);
}

// Typed peer lookup — returns None instead of panicking when the
// request didn't arrive over mTLS.
if let Some(certs) = ctx.peer_certs() {
    authorize(certs)?;
}
```

| `Response<B>` field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `body` | The response message (or `ServiceStream<M>` for streaming) |
| `headers` | Headers to send before the body |
| `trailers` | Trailers to send after the body |
| `compress` | Override the server's compression policy for this RPC |

`ServiceResult<B>` is `Result<Response<B>, ConnectError>`. The happy
path is `Response::ok(body)`; to attach response metadata, use the
builder:

```rust
async fn greet(
    &self,
    _ctx: RequestContext,
    req: ServiceRequest<'_, GreetRequest>,
) -> ServiceResult<GreetResponse> {
    Ok(Response::new(GreetResponse { /* ... */ })
        .with_header("x-greet-version", "v2")
        .with_trailer("x-server-id", "node-7"))
}
```

`RequestContext::extensions()` is the passthrough channel for tower-layer
state: a custom auth layer can stamp a `UserId` into the request's
`http::Extensions`, and the dispatcher forwards that map verbatim into the
request context for the handler to read with
`ctx.extensions().get::<UserId>()`. For the well-known peer types, prefer
the typed `ctx.peer_addr()` / `ctx.peer_certs()` accessors — they return
`None` rather than panicking when the transport didn't insert them. See
[Tower middleware](#tower-middleware) for the full pattern.

### What you see vs. what you write

The generated trait declares unary methods with the full RPITIT bounds:

    fn say(&self, ctx: RequestContext, req: ...)
        -> impl Future<Output = ServiceResult<impl Encodable<SayResponse> + Send + 'static + use<Self>>> + Send;

That is what `cargo doc` and rust-analyzer hover show. You never write
that form in an impl - `async fn` desugars the outer `impl Future`, and
returning `ServiceResult<SayResponse>` (the concrete owned type) refines
the `impl Encodable<...>` bound. The short form in the examples above is
all you need.

### The `refining_impl_trait` lint

The generated trait declares unary/client-stream returns as
`ServiceResult<impl Encodable<M>>` so handlers can return either the
owned `M` or a borrowed view that encodes as `M` (see below). Writing
your impl as `-> ServiceResult<FooResponse>` *refines* that opaque
bound to a concrete type, which triggers
`refining_impl_trait_internal` / `refining_impl_trait_reachable`. This
is intentional - the refinement is the point. Add at your crate root:

```rust
#![allow(refining_impl_trait_internal, refining_impl_trait_reachable)]
```

or `#[allow(refining_impl_trait)]` on the impl block.

### Returning a view body

For handlers that often return the request unchanged (proxies, filters,
validators), the `Encodable<M>` bound lets you skip the owned-message
allocation by returning an `OwnedView` rebuilt zero-copy from the
retained request bytes (the request itself is borrowed and cannot
outlive the call, so it is re-decoded - a Bytes refcount bump plus a
decode walk, with no per-field copy). Codegen emits
`OwnedFooView` aliases and `impl Encodable<Foo> for OwnedFooView` per
RPC type (or, with `encodable_impls=all_messages`, the impls for every
message in the generated crate - the aliases stay RPC-scoped). (When two RPC types in the same package would alias to the
same `OwnedFooView` name — e.g. a local `MyMessage` plus an imported
`api.v1.foo.bar.MyMessage` — the alias is suppressed for both; spell
the inlined `OwnedView<…View<'static>>` form for those types.) `connectrpc::MaybeBorrowed` covers the conditional case:

```rust
use connectrpc::{MaybeBorrowed, RequestContext, Response, ServiceRequest, ServiceResult};
// `Record` and `OwnedRecordView` come from your generated module.

async fn redact(
    &self,
    _ctx: RequestContext,
    req: ServiceRequest<'_, Record>,
) -> ServiceResult<MaybeBorrowed<Record, OwnedRecordView>> {
    if req.email.is_empty() && req.ssn.is_empty() {
        // Pass-through. The response must be 'static, so rebuild an
        // OwnedView from the retained body bytes - zero-copy (Bytes
        // refcount + decode walk), then re-encode via ViewEncode.
        return Response::ok(MaybeBorrowed::Borrowed(req.to_owned_view()));
    }
    let mut owned = req.to_owned_message();
    owned.email.clear();
    owned.ssn.clear();
    Response::ok(MaybeBorrowed::Owned(owned))
}
```

The `'a` on the trait method also lets the body borrow from `&self`
(e.g. cached server state). View bodies only encode for the proto
codec - JSON clients receive `unimplemented`; see
[`MaybeBorrowed`'s codec note](https://docs.rs/connectrpc/latest/connectrpc/enum.MaybeBorrowed.html#codec-compatibility).
View-body impls are not emitted for output types mapped via
`extern_path` (the impl would be an orphan in the consuming crate) -
the impls must live in the crate that owns the type. If you generate
that crate yourself, regenerate it with `encodable_impls=all_messages`
(see the `protoc-gen-connect-rust` option docs) and views of its types
become returnable from any crate. For types you don't generate (e.g.
well-known types from `buffa-types`), return the owned message or use
`PreEncoded::from_view`.

### Returning errors

Handlers return `ConnectError` for failures. Each error carries an
`ErrorCode` (the canonical Connect/gRPC status), a message, optional
structured details, and optional metadata (headers + trailers):

```rust
use connectrpc::{ConnectError, ErrorCode};

return Err(ConnectError::new(
    ErrorCode::NotFound,
    format!("user {name:?} not found"),
));
```

The dispatcher maps `ErrorCode` to the appropriate HTTP status and
serializes the error in the protocol the caller is using (Connect
JSON, Connect binary, gRPC trailers, or gRPC-Web). Handlers don't
need to know which protocol the caller chose.

### Registering services on a Router

Register generated services from the router so multiple services read
top-to-bottom:

```rust
let router = Router::new()
    .add_service(Arc::new(MyGreet))
    .add_service(Arc::new(MyBilling));
```

The generated `register` extension method remains available when the
inside-out form is useful:

```rust
let router = Arc::new(MyGreet).register(Router::new());
```

To combine routers that were built separately, use `Router::merge` (owned,
chainable), `Router::merge_in_place` (in place), or the `merge_routers` free
function for many at once. Merging two routers that register the same method
path panics by default, so an accidental collision fails loudly at startup;
call `Router::allow_overrides()` first when last-wins replacement is intended:

```rust
let router = defaults.allow_overrides().merge(overrides);
```

When the routers come from dynamic input (a plugin list, config-driven
service set) and a collision should be handled rather than crash the process,
use `Router::try_merge` / `Router::try_merge_in_place`, which return a
`RouterMergeError` listing the conflicting paths instead of panicking.

The router is what you mount on axum (`router.into_axum_router()`)
or pass to the built-in `Server`.

### Testing handlers

Handlers are plain async methods, so unit tests call them directly -
no server, no sockets. Construct the inputs the same way the dispatcher
does:

```rust
use buffa::Message;               // encode_to_vec / decode_from_slice
use buffa::view::HasMessageView;  // GreetRequest::decode_view

#[tokio::test]
async fn greet_uses_the_name() {
    let svc = GreetServiceImpl::default();

    // Unary: encode the request, decode a view over it, wrap the pair.
    let body = Bytes::from(GreetRequest {
        name: "ada".into(),
        ..Default::default()
    }.encode_to_vec());
    let view = GreetRequest::decode_view(&body).unwrap();
    let req = ServiceRequest::<GreetRequest>::from_parts(&view, &body);

    let resp = svc.greet(RequestContext::new(HeaderMap::new()), req)
        .await
        .unwrap();

    // The trait's response body is an opaque `impl Encodable<GreetResponse>`;
    // encode it (exactly what the dispatcher does) and decode to assert on
    // fields. Headers and trailers are directly accessible on `resp`. The
    // UFCS call avoids ambiguity with `buffa::Message::encode`, which is
    // also in scope.
    use connectrpc::Encodable;
    let bytes = Encodable::encode(&resp.body, CodecFormat::Proto).unwrap();
    let reply = GreetResponse::decode_from_slice(&bytes).unwrap();
    assert_eq!(reply.greeting, "Hello, ada!");
}
```

Streaming inputs are one call each: `StreamMessage::from_message(&msg)`
builds an item, and `futures::stream::iter([...])` boxed into an
`InboundStream` builds the request stream:

```rust
let items = [Ok(StreamMessage::from_message(&SumRequest {
    value: Some(3), ..Default::default()
}))];
let requests: InboundStream<SumRequest> =
    Box::pin(futures::stream::iter(items));
let resp = svc.sum(RequestContext::new(HeaderMap::new()), requests).await?;
```

`RequestContext::new` takes the request headers; its `with_*` builders
cover peer identity and other per-call inputs.

## Streaming RPCs

ConnectRPC supports all four RPC types. Define them in your `.proto`
file with the standard `stream` keyword:

```protobuf
service NumberService {
  rpc Square(SquareRequest) returns (SquareResponse);                 // unary
  rpc Range(RangeRequest) returns (stream RangeResponse);             // server stream
  rpc Sum(stream SumRequest) returns (SumResponse);                   // client stream
  rpc RunningSum(stream RunningSumRequest) returns (stream RunningSumResponse);  // bidi
}
```

The runnable demo for each type lives in
[`examples/streaming-tour/`](../examples/streaming-tour). The handler
signatures are summarized below.

The streaming-handler trait signatures use `Pin<Box<dyn Stream<...> +
Send>>` for both inbound and outbound streams. That's verbose, so the
snippets here use `connectrpc::ServiceStream<T>` (a boxed `Send`
stream of `Result<T, ConnectError>`).

### Server streaming

The handler returns a stream of responses. Use any `futures::Stream`
you like, then wrap it with `Response::stream_ok` (or
`Ok(Response::stream(s).with_header(...))` if you need response
metadata):

```rust
async fn range(
    &self,
    _ctx: RequestContext,
    req: ServiceRequest<'_, RangeRequest>,
) -> ServiceResult<ServiceStream<RangeResponse>> {
    let stream = futures::stream::iter(/* ... */);
    Response::stream_ok(stream)
}
```

### Client streaming

The handler receives an `InboundStream<Req>` — a `ServiceStream` of
`StreamMessage<Req>` items — and returns a single response. Each item
owns its decoded buffer, is `Send + 'static` (so it can be buffered or
moved into spawned tasks), and exposes zero-copy accessor methods per
field:

```rust
async fn sum(
    &self,
    _ctx: RequestContext,
    mut requests: InboundStream<SumRequest>,
) -> ServiceResult<SumResponse> {
    let mut total: i64 = 0;
    while let Some(req) = requests.next().await {
        total += req?.value().unwrap_or(0) as i64;
    }
    Response::ok(SumResponse { total: Some(total), ..Default::default() })
}
```

The request stream yields `Err(ConnectError)` if the upload fails partway
— a truncated body or broken transport — so a partial stream is not
mistaken for a complete one. The `req?` in the loop above propagates that
error as the RPC's failure, which is the right default for handlers that
aggregate inbound messages. Only a clean `None` means the client finished
the stream.

### Bidirectional streaming

Takes a request stream and returns a response stream. Both sides can
emit messages independently:

```rust
async fn running_sum(
    &self,
    _ctx: RequestContext,
    requests: InboundStream<RunningSumRequest>,
) -> ServiceResult<ServiceStream<RunningSumResponse>> {
    // Map the request stream to a response stream however you like.
    let response_stream = futures::stream::unfold(/* ... */);
    Response::stream_ok(response_stream)
}
```

For bidirectional streams that need true full-duplex behavior (server
emits messages independently of client send rate), use a
`tokio::sync::mpsc` channel: spawn a task that reads from `requests`
and writes to the channel sender, return a
`ReceiverStream` as the response. See `tests/streaming/src/lib.rs`
for an example.

### Calling streaming RPCs from a client

Generated clients expose a method for each RPC. Server streaming
returns a stream you call `.message().await?` on; bidi returns a
handle with `.send(req).await?` and `.message().await?` plus
`.close_send()`:

```rust
// Server streaming. Each item is a `StreamMessage` - the same wrapper
// server handlers receive for inbound streams. Read fields zero-copy
// via `.view()` (or the generated accessor methods), and convert with
// `.to_owned_message()` when you need the owned struct.
let mut stream = client.range(req).await?;
while let Some(msg) = stream.message().await? {
    println!("{}", msg.view().value.unwrap_or_default());
}

// Client streaming - takes an async `Stream` of requests, so messages
// can be produced as they become available without buffering the whole
// upload. A ready collection is adapted with `stream_iter` (a re-export
// of `futures::stream::iter`, so no direct `futures` dependency needed):
let resp = client
    .sum(connectrpc::stream_iter(vec![req1, req2, req3]))
    .await?;

// ...or feed the call from a live producer through a channel-backed
// stream (add the `tokio-stream` crate for the wrapper). The generated
// bound, `ClientRequestStream<T>`, is `Stream<Item = T> + Send + 'static`:
// the stream backs the request body, so yield owned messages rather than
// borrows of local data.
let (tx, rx) = tokio::sync::mpsc::channel(16);
tokio::spawn(async move {
    while let Some(chunk) = source.recv().await {
        if tx.send(request_for(chunk)).await.is_err() {
            break; // call ended — stop producing
        }
    }
});
let resp = client
    .sum(tokio_stream::wrappers::ReceiverStream::new(rx))
    .await?;

// Bidi - received items are `StreamMessage`s too
let mut bidi = client.running_sum().await?;
bidi.send(req).await?;
if let Some(reply) = bidi.message().await? {
    println!("{}", reply.view().total.unwrap_or_default());
}
bidi.close_send();

// For true full duplex, split the bidi stream into independently owned
// halves and drive them from separate tasks. Response-dependent sends
// require an HTTP/2 transport (on HTTP/1.1 no response arrives until the
// upload completes). Dropping the send half ends the upload cleanly;
// dropping the receive half cancels the RPC.
let (mut send, mut recv) = client.running_sum().await?.into_split();
let reader = tokio::spawn(async move {
    while let Some(reply) = recv.message().await? {
        println!("{}", reply.view().total.unwrap_or_default());
    }
    Ok::<_, connectrpc::ConnectError>(())
});
for req in requests {
    send.send(req).await?;
}
send.close_send();
reader.await.expect("reader task")?;
```

`?` on `message()` is the complete error handling: `Ok(None)` means the
server finished cleanly, and a terminal RPC error — including a
gRPC/gRPC-Web stream that ends without a usable `grpc-status` — comes
back as `Err`, sticky across calls. The `error()` and `trailers()`
accessors remain available afterwards for post-hoc inspection.

Dropping a client-streaming call cancels it: the request body is dropped
with the future, so messages the stream had not yet yielded never reach
the server. Wrapping such a call in a `timeout` therefore abandons the
upload rather than truncating it cleanly — drive the call to completion
whenever the request must be delivered.

Both `streaming-tour/src/client.rs` and the eliza example show these
patterns end-to-end.

## Tower middleware

The connect router is a `tower::Service`, so any tower layer composes
on top. The full reference is in
[`examples/middleware/`](../examples/middleware), which uses an
`axum::middleware::from_fn` for bearer-token auth and chains it with
`tower-http`'s `TraceLayer` and `TimeoutLayer`.

### Composing layers

Use `tower::ServiceBuilder` for clear top-to-bottom ordering, mounted
on `axum::Router::layer()` so axum handles the body conversion from
`ConnectRpcBody` to `axum::body::Body`:

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::time::Duration;
use tower::ServiceBuilder;
use tower_http::{trace::TraceLayer, timeout::TimeoutLayer};

let connect_router = Router::new().add_service(service);
let tokens = Arc::new(token_table());
let app = axum::Router::new()
    .fallback_service(connect_router.into_axum_service())
    .layer(
        ServiceBuilder::new()
            .layer(TraceLayer::new_for_http())                  // outermost
            .layer(axum::middleware::from_fn_with_state(tokens, auth_middleware))
            .layer(TimeoutLayer::with_status_code(              // innermost
                http::StatusCode::REQUEST_TIMEOUT,
                Duration::from_secs(5),
            )),
    );
```

ServiceBuilder applies layers top-to-bottom: the first `.layer()`
sees requests first (and responses last). A request flows
trace -> auth -> timeout -> dispatcher -> handler.

For auth and similar interceptors, `axum::middleware::from_fn` (or
`from_fn_with_state` for stateful cases) is usually the lightest path
because it lets you write the middleware as a plain async function.
A hand-rolled `tower::Layer` + `tower::Service` pair is also fine
when you need finer control - both produce a `Layer` that
ServiceBuilder accepts.

### Passing data from a layer to a handler

The dispatch path moves the request's `http::Extensions` into the
request context verbatim. So a middleware that inserts a value via
`req.extensions_mut().insert(value)` makes that value available to the
handler via `ctx.extensions().get::<T>()`. This is the canonical way to
pass per-request state from middleware (auth identity, trace IDs, remote
addr, TLS peer info) into the handler.

The middleware example does exactly this with a `UserId`:

```rust
// In the auth middleware:
req.extensions_mut().insert(UserId(user.into()));
next.run(req).await

// In the handler:
let user = ctx.extensions().get::<UserId>().unwrap();
```

### Static method metadata (`Spec`)

Handlers and middleware can read which RPC method is being invoked
without re-parsing the request URL. `ctx.spec()` returns an
`Option<Spec>` describing the dispatched method: its fully-qualified
procedure path, message-flow shape, the proto-declared idempotency
contract, and whether the spec came from a server-side dispatcher or a
generated client.

```rust
async fn greet(
    &self,
    ctx: RequestContext,
    req: ServiceRequest<'_, GreetRequest>,
) -> ServiceResult<GreetResponse> {
    if let Some(spec) = ctx.spec() {
        tracing::info_span!(
            "rpc",
            "rpc.system" = "connect_rpc",
            "rpc.service" = spec.service(),
            "rpc.method" = spec.method(),
        );
    }
    // ...
}
```

`ctx.protocol()` is the per-request companion: it returns the negotiated
wire protocol (`Connect`, `Grpc`, or `GrpcWeb`) so an observability
layer can label spans with `rpc.system` correctly. `Spec` carries only
**registration-time** facts that are the same for every request to that
method; per-request state lives on `RequestContext`. This mirrors
`connect-go`'s `Spec` / `Peer` split.

`Spec` is `Copy`, contains only `'static` data, and is `#[non_exhaustive]`
— destructure with a trailing `..`:

```rust
use connectrpc::{Spec, SpecOrigin, StreamType, IdempotencyLevel};

let Spec { procedure, stream_type, origin, idempotency_level, .. } = spec;
```

Code generation also emits a `pub const <SERVICE>_<METHOD>_SPEC: Spec`
per method that you can reference directly without a request in flight —
useful for building static lookup tables, validating routing, or testing:

```rust,ignore
use crate::connect::greet::v1::GREET_SERVICE_GREET_SPEC;

assert_eq!(GREET_SERVICE_GREET_SPEC.procedure, "/greet.v1.GreetService/Greet");
assert_eq!(GREET_SERVICE_GREET_SPEC.stream_type, StreamType::Unary);
assert_eq!(GREET_SERVICE_GREET_SPEC.origin, SpecOrigin::Server);
```

> **Both dispatch paths populate `ctx.spec()`.** A code-generated
> `FooServiceServer<T>` always supplies a `Spec`. The dynamic `Router`
> (used by `FooServiceExt::register(Router)`) does too — the generated
> `register()` chains `.with_spec(SPEC_CONST)` after each route. The
> only handlers that see `ctx.spec() == None` are those registered
> through low-level manual registration without attaching a `Spec`.
> `ctx.path()` is populated unconditionally regardless of dispatch path
> — use it when you only need the procedure name and want to be robust
> to a missing `Spec`.

### Short-circuit responses

A layer can short-circuit by returning a response without invoking
the inner service. The middleware example does this for unauthorized
requests, returning a 401 with a Connect-protocol JSON error body so
clients see the failure on the same code path they use for handler
errors.

## Interceptors

Tower middleware (above) operates on `http::Request` / `http::Response`
— it's the right level for cross-cutting concerns that don't need to
know they're wrapping an RPC: connection-scoped tracing, gzip, raw
header manipulation. **Interceptors** are the typed RPC layer on top: a
single async hook per call that runs after envelope decoding,
decompression, and protocol header parsing, and before the handler.
Interceptors see the resolved [`Spec`](#static-method-metadata-spec),
the parsed headers, the deadline, the negotiated protocol, the request
extensions, and a lazily decoded message body — everything an auth
boundary, span builder, validator, or rate limiter actually wants.

```rust,ignore
use connectrpc::interceptor::{UnaryRequest, UnaryResponse};
use connectrpc::{ConnectError, Interceptor, Next};

struct Logging;

#[connectrpc::async_trait]
impl Interceptor for Logging {
    async fn intercept_unary(
        &self,
        req: UnaryRequest,
        next: Next<'_>,
    ) -> Result<UnaryResponse, ConnectError> {
        let path = req.ctx.path().unwrap_or("<unknown>").to_owned();
        let started = std::time::Instant::now();
        let resp = next.run(req).await;
        tracing::info!(rpc = %path, elapsed = ?started.elapsed(), ok = resp.is_ok());
        resp
    }
}

let server = GreetServiceServer::new(GreetServiceImpl);
let service = ConnectRpcService::new(server).with_interceptor(Logging);
```

Annotate impls with the re-exported `#[connectrpc::async_trait]` — there
is no separate `async-trait` dependency for downstream crates. The
default impls are passthroughs, so you only override the hook you need.
For one-off interceptors, the `unary_interceptor` and
`streaming_interceptor` closure helpers skip the struct boilerplate.

### Ordering and registration

`with_interceptor` registers in **outermost-first** order, matching
`connect-go`'s `WithInterceptors`: the first interceptor registered
sees the request first and the response last.

```text
.with_interceptor(A).with_interceptor(B)

request:   A → B → handler
response:  A ← B ← handler
```

A service with no interceptors registered pays one `is_empty()` branch
on the dispatch path — no per-request allocation, no `Payload`
construction, no `Box`ing.

To share one interceptor instance across several `ConnectRpcService`s
(an auth interceptor whose token cache or rate-limit counter is
process-wide), use `with_interceptor_arc(Arc<dyn Interceptor>)`.
`with_interceptor` allocates a fresh `Arc` per registration;
`with_interceptor_arc` accepts the one you already hold.

### Reading and rewriting the request

`UnaryRequest` is `{ ctx: RequestContext, payload: Payload }`. Mutating
`ctx` (headers, extensions) before `next.run` propagates to the handler.
The `payload` is the request body — wire bytes plus a lazy decode
cache. Most interceptors never read it; ones that do call
`payload.message::<M>()` to decode once and cache, so the handler's
decode is free:

```rust,ignore
async fn intercept_unary(
    &self,
    mut req: UnaryRequest,
    next: Next<'_>,
) -> Result<UnaryResponse, ConnectError> {
    // Decode once; the handler reuses this decode via the Payload cache.
    let body = req.payload.message::<GreetRequest>()?;
    if body.name.is_empty() {
        return Err(ConnectError::invalid_argument("name is required"));
    }
    // Replace the body — the handler sees the replacement.
    let mut rewritten = body.clone();
    rewritten.name = rewritten.name.trim().to_owned();
    req.payload.set_message(rewritten);
    next.run(req).await
}
```

### Short-circuiting

Returning without calling `next.run()` short-circuits the chain —
neither inner interceptors nor the handler run. Returning `Err`
surfaces the error on the protocol's normal error path, including
any `response_headers` the error carries:

```rust,ignore
async fn intercept_unary(
    &self,
    req: UnaryRequest,
    next: Next<'_>,
) -> Result<UnaryResponse, ConnectError> {
    let Some(token) = req.ctx.header("authorization") else {
        let mut err = ConnectError::unauthenticated("missing bearer token");
        err.response_headers_mut().insert(
            http::header::WWW_AUTHENTICATE,
            http::HeaderValue::from_static("Bearer"),
        );
        return Err(err);
    };
    self.tokens.verify(token)?;
    next.run(req).await
}
```

### Streaming RPCs

`intercept_streaming` covers server-streaming, client-streaming, and
bidi with one `Stream`-shaped hook. It runs once at stream
establishment — before any messages flow — and receives an inbound
`PayloadStream` plus a `NextStream<'_>` continuation. The returned
`StreamResponse` carries the outbound `PayloadStream` and response
metadata.

```rust,ignore
use connectrpc::interceptor::{StreamRequest, StreamResponse};
use connectrpc::{Interceptor, NextStream, PayloadStream};

#[connectrpc::async_trait]
impl Interceptor for AuthInterceptor {
    async fn intercept_streaming(
        &self,
        req: StreamRequest,
        inbound: PayloadStream,
        next: NextStream<'_>,
    ) -> Result<StreamResponse, ConnectError> {
        // Auth runs once at establishment, not per message.
        self.check(&req.ctx)?;
        let resp = next.run(req, inbound).await?;
        Ok(resp.with_header("x-served-by", &self.node_id))
    }
}
```

To observe or transform individual messages, wrap `inbound` (or the
returned `resp.body`) with a `futures::Stream` adapter — `.map()`,
`.then()`, `.filter()`. There is no per-message `send()` call site to
hook because Rust handlers *return* a `Stream`, they don't *push* into
a connection. This is the same shape `tower`, `tonic`, and `axum` use
for body interception. Cross-stream coordination (deciding on an
outbound item based on what was observed inbound) needs shared state
captured by both adapter closures (`Arc<Mutex<..>>`); this is rare —
most interceptors observe one direction or none.

For server-streaming the inbound stream yields exactly one item; for
client-streaming the outbound stream yields exactly one item. Read
`req.ctx.spec().map(|s| s.stream_type)` to branch on cardinality.

### Interceptors vs. Tower middleware

| | Tower middleware | Interceptor |
|---|---|---|
| Operates on | `http::Request` / `http::Response` | Decoded RPC: `Spec`, headers, deadline, `Payload` |
| Runs | Before envelope decode + protocol parse | After envelope decode + protocol parse |
| Sees the RPC method | No (must re-parse the URI) | Yes (`ctx.path()`, `ctx.spec()`) |
| Sees the message body | Compressed/enveloped wire bytes | Lazily decoded, codec-aware `Payload` |
| Short-circuits | By returning an `http::Response` | By returning `Err` or a `UnaryResponse` |
| Best for | gzip, raw header rewriting, generic HTTP concerns | Auth, RPC-aware tracing, validation, rate limiting |

Both compose: a Tower layer wraps the whole `ConnectRpcService`
(including its interceptor chain). An interceptor that needs an
HTTP-level fact (e.g. the remote socket address) reads it from
`ctx.extensions()` after a Tower layer inserts it.

## Hosting

### With axum (recommended)

`Router::into_axum_service()` returns a tower service you mount via
`axum::Router::fallback_service`, and `into_axum_router()` returns a
ready-to-merge axum router. This is the common path because it lets
you compose connect RPC routes with regular HTTP routes (health
checks, static files, OAuth callbacks):

```rust
let app = axum::Router::new()
    .route("/health", axum::routing::get(|| async { "OK" }))
    .fallback_service(connect_router.into_axum_service())
    .layer(/* tower layers */);

let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("0.0.0.0:8080").await?;
axum::serve(listener, app).await?;
```

### Standalone server

Enable the `server` feature for a built-in hyper-based server. This
is the no-frills path when you don't need axum's routing or per-route
configuration:

```rust
use connectrpc::Server;

let connect_router = Router::new().add_service(service);
Server::new(connect_router)
    .serve("127.0.0.1:8080".parse()?)
    .await?;
```

The standalone `Server` handles HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 with prior knowledge,
and graceful shutdown. It's a single dispatcher with no per-route
configuration, so add things like health endpoints either as RPC
methods or by mounting the Connect service in axum.

For connection and HTTP/2 settings that `Server` does not expose, drop
down to raw hyper instead.

### Advanced transport configuration

The built-in `Server` exposes the common connection knobs, but it does
not try to mirror every hyper option. For long-tail transport tuning —
flow-control windows, HPACK table size, frame size, or exact keepalive
behavior — drive the Connect service from your own hyper accept loop.

Add `hyper-util` as a direct dependency with the `server-auto`,
`service`, and `tokio` features enabled. Then wrap `ConnectRpcService`
with `TowerToHyperService` before handing each connection to hyper's
auto builder:

```rust,ignore
use connectrpc::{ConnectRpcService, Router};
use hyper_util::{
    rt::{TokioExecutor, TokioIo},
    server::conn::auto::Builder as AutoBuilder,
    service::TowerToHyperService,
};

let connect_router = Router::new().add_service(greeter_service);
let connect_service = ConnectRpcService::new(connect_router);

let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("0.0.0.0:8080").await?;
let mut builder = AutoBuilder::new(TokioExecutor::new());
builder
    .http2()
    .max_concurrent_streams(1_000)
    .max_frame_size(1 << 20)
    .adaptive_window(true);

loop {
    let (stream, _peer_addr) = listener.accept().await?;
    let conn = builder
        .serve_connection(
            TokioIo::new(stream),
            TowerToHyperService::new(connect_service.clone()),
        )
        .into_owned();

    tokio::spawn(async move {
        if let Err(err) = conn.await {
            eprintln!("connection ended with error: {err}");
        }
    });
}
```

This is the escape hatch for connection- and protocol-level settings.
Axum remains the better fit for routing, health checks, ordinary HTTP
endpoints, and request-level Tower middleware such as auth, timeouts,
or rate limiting.

Unlike the built-in `Server` and `connectrpc::axum::serve_tls`, a raw
hyper loop does not automatically insert `PeerAddr` or `PeerCerts` into
request extensions. If handlers call `ctx.peer_addr()` or
`ctx.peer_certs()`, insert those extensions in your own Tower layer or
service wrapper before the request reaches `ConnectRpcService`.

### TLS

Enable the `server-tls` feature (or the `tls` umbrella feature for
both server and client TLS).

For the standalone `Server`:

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;

let server_config: Arc<rustls::ServerConfig> = /* load PEMs, build config */;

Server::new(connect_router)
    .with_tls(server_config)
    .serve("0.0.0.0:8443".parse()?)
    .await?;
```

For the axum path, `connectrpc::axum::serve_tls` (requires both the
`axum` and `server-tls` features) is a drop-in replacement for
`axum::serve` that owns the rustls accept loop and stamps `PeerAddr` /
`PeerCerts` into request extensions exactly as the standalone `Server`
does, so handler code that reads `ctx.peer_certs()` is portable across
both hosting paths:

```rust
let app = axum::Router::new()
    .route("/health", axum::routing::get(|| async { "OK" }))
    .fallback_service(connect_router.into_axum_service());

let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("0.0.0.0:8443").await?;
connectrpc::axum::serve_tls(listener, app, server_config)
    .with_graceful_shutdown(shutdown_signal)
    .await?;
```

The eliza example
([`examples/eliza/README.md`](../examples/eliza/README.md)) walks
through generating self-signed certificates with openssl, configuring
mTLS via `--client-ca`, and the rustls strict-PKI requirement that
your CA cert must be distinct from the server leaf cert. The
mtls-identity example
([`examples/mtls-identity/README.md`](../examples/mtls-identity/README.md))
demonstrates `serve_tls` end-to-end with cert-SAN identity extraction
and an ACL keyed on it.

## Health checking

The `connectrpc-health` crate implements the standard
`grpc.health.v1.Health` service. Mount it on your Connect router and
clients like `grpc_health_probe`, kubelet's `grpc:` probe, and gRPC-aware
service meshes (Linkerd, Istio) just work.

This is the gRPC protocol — different from the plain HTTP `GET /health`
route shown earlier in the [Hosting](#hosting) section. Keep the HTTP
route for `httpGet:` probes; add the gRPC service for `grpc:` probes.

```toml
[dependencies]
connectrpc = { version = "0.8", features = ["server"] }
connectrpc-health = "0.8"
```

```rust,no_run
use connectrpc::Router;
use connectrpc_health::{install_static, Status};

// `install_static` registers every name with `Status::Serving`; use the
// generated `*_SERVICE_NAME` constants from your service stubs so the
// registered name matches exactly what clients ask for. The
// whole-process `""` entry is seeded for you, so probes that don't
// pass a service name also work.
let (router, health) = install_static(Router::new(), [
    proto::greet::v1::GREET_SERVICE_SERVICE_NAME,
]);

// Flip status when something goes wrong. `set_status` errors on an
// unknown name, so typos surface immediately instead of silently
// shadowing the real entry.
health
    .set_status(proto::greet::v1::GREET_SERVICE_SERVICE_NAME, Status::NotServing)
    .expect("registered above");

// At shutdown, drain. `shutdown()` flips every registered service,
// including the empty whole-process entry:
health.shutdown();
```

For custom logic (e.g. report `NotServing` while a database connection
is down), implement the `Checker` trait directly and wrap it in
`HealthService::new(...)` or `HealthService::from_arc(...)`. The default
`Checker::watch` body returns `Unimplemented`, which is fine for
Check-only probes; override it if your probes call Watch.

The `HealthClient` (for in-process probes, integration tests, sidecar
tooling) is gated on a `client` Cargo feature that is **on by default**.
Server-only deployments turn it off:

```toml
[dependencies]
connectrpc = { version = "0.8", features = ["server"] }
connectrpc-health = { version = "0.8", default-features = false }
```

That drops `connectrpc/client` (the HTTP/2 transport stack) from the
dependency graph entirely. `use connectrpc_health::HealthClient` then
becomes an unresolved import, but the binary stays lean.

**Unknown services on `Watch`.** Non-empty unregistered services return
`Err(ConnectError::not_found(_))` from both `Check` and `Watch`; the
empty service auto-subscribes on `Watch` and returns `Serving` on
`Check` by default. The gRPC Health spec additionally describes a
`SERVICE_UNKNOWN` keep-stream-open flow for `Watch` that this crate
does not implement, matching the Go `connectrpc.com/grpchealth`
reference. Every probe that treats any error as a failure — kubelet's
`grpc:` probe, `grpc_health_probe`, Linkerd, Istio — works unchanged.
See `HealthService`'s `# Unknown services` section in the crate docs
for the full context.

## Server reflection

The `connectrpc-reflection` crate implements the standard gRPC server
reflection service (`grpc.reflection.v1` and its `v1alpha` predecessor),
so schema-aware clients — `grpcurl`, `buf curl`, Postman, `grpcui` —
can discover and call your services without local proto files, over
gRPC, gRPC-Web, and the Connect protocol alike.

```toml
[dependencies]
connectrpc = { version = "0.8", features = ["server"] }
connectrpc-reflection = "0.8"
```

Emit a descriptor set from your build script (see
[Code generation](#code-generation)), embed it, and mount the service:

```rust,ignore
// build.rs: .emit_descriptor_set("app.fds.bin") before .compile()
use connectrpc::Router;
use connectrpc_reflection::{Reflector, install};

let bytes: &[u8] = include_bytes!(concat!(env!("OUT_DIR"), "/app.fds.bin"));
let reflector = Reflector::from_descriptor_set_bytes(bytes)?;
// `router` is your service router from `register()`.
let router = install(router, reflector); // mounts v1 + v1alpha
```

Alternatively, when your buffa codegen has reflection enabled, serve
straight from the generated package's descriptor pool with
`Reflector::from_descriptor_pool(proto::descriptor_pool().clone())` —
no build-script step. The bytes path answers with the compiler's
original per-file descriptor bytes; the pool path re-encodes
(semantically faithful, unknown fields preserved). See the `Reflector`
crate docs for the trade-off.

> **Reflection intentionally publishes your schema.** Everything in
> the descriptor set is exposed — all files, their transitive imports,
> and every compiled service, whether or not its handlers are mounted.
> Gate or omit the service on deployments where that is not wanted.

Two more behaviors worth knowing before deploying:

- **`Reflector::with_services` curates the advertised list** (the
  override is verbatim, like Go `grpcreflect`'s `Namer`) — use it when
  the descriptor set compiles in more services than you want to
  advertise; `Reflector::service_names` inspects the current list.
- **The service is self-describing**: queries about `grpc.reflection.*`
  fall back to the crate's own descriptors and `ListServices` includes
  the reflection services, matching grpc-go. Schema-free callers like
  `buf curl` need this to invoke `ServerReflectionInfo` at all.

The [multiservice example](../examples/multiservice) mounts reflection
with both descriptor sources (selectable via `REFLECTION_SOURCE=fds|pool`),
and [`reflection-demo.sh`](../examples/multiservice/reflection-demo.sh)
walks through discovery and schema-free calls with `buf curl`.

## Production hardening

### Deadline policy

Connect and gRPC clients send a per-request timeout header
(`Connect-Timeout-Ms` or `grpc-timeout`). With no policy, the server
trusts that value verbatim: a `Connect-Timeout-Ms: 1` request cancels
the handler mid-write, while a `Connect-Timeout-Ms: 86400000` request
holds a worker for 24 hours, and a request with no timeout header runs
unbounded. `DeadlinePolicy` gives the server the say.

```rust,ignore
use connectrpc::{ConnectRpcService, DeadlinePolicy};
use std::time::Duration;

let policy = DeadlinePolicy::new()
    .with_min(Duration::from_millis(5))           // floor: reject "cancel me instantly"
    .with_max(Duration::from_secs(30))            // cap: bound worker lifetime
    .with_default_timeout(Duration::from_secs(10)) // applied when client asserts nothing
    .with_enforce_on_streams(true);               // also cut off streaming bodies

let service = ConnectRpcService::new(router)
    .with_deadline_policy(policy);
// or: Server::new(router).with_deadline_policy(policy)
```

Why each knob:

- **`with_max`** is the most important one for any service that accepts
  untrusted callers — without it a client controls how long a worker
  stays busy. Set it to your longest acceptable request — for unary and
  server-streaming RPCs the capped budget covers receiving the request
  body as well as handler execution, so size it for uploads, not just
  handler runtime.
- **`with_default_timeout`** matters because the timeout header is
  optional. A request that omits it has no bound at all unless you set
  one. Set it to your SLA. For unary and server-streaming RPCs, the
  budget includes receiving the request body as well as handler execution.
- **`with_min`** protects against a misbehaving or adversarial client
  cancelling the handler before it can do anything (e.g. mid-write on a
  streaming response). A few milliseconds is usually enough.
- **`with_enforce_on_streams(true)`** closes the streaming-body gap.
  By default the deadline only bounds the time-to-first-response —
  once a server- or bidi-streaming handler returns its stream, the
  items flow unbounded. Enabling this wraps the response body so the
  next item after the deadline is a `deadline_exceeded` error and the
  stream ends. Cancellation drops the inner stream at the next yield
  point with no grace period; spawn commit-critical work off the
  request future if it must outlive the caller.
- **`with_inter_message_timeout(d)`** detects stalled streams (a
  handler waiting on a slow upstream). Independent of
  `with_enforce_on_streams` — takes effect whenever set, with or
  without the absolute deadline. Arms when the response stream is
  first polled (stream-setup latency before that is not counted) and
  resets on each yielded item.

`DeadlinePolicy::new()` with no `with_*` calls is a no-op that
preserves the prior default behavior. Existing services see no change
without opting in.

When a client value is clamped, a `tracing::debug!` event fires on
target `connectrpc::deadline` with the path and before/after
durations. Enable `RUST_LOG=connectrpc::deadline=debug` to spot
misbehaving clients.

Inside a handler, `ctx.deadline()` reflects the *moderated* value
(after clamping), so the handler can budget downstream calls —
propagate the remaining time minus a margin as the timeout for
outbound RPCs. `ctx.time_remaining()` does the subtraction for you
(`None` when the request has no deadline):

```rust,ignore
if let Some(remaining) = ctx.time_remaining() {
    options = options.with_timeout(remaining.saturating_sub(margin));
}
```

## Clients

Enable the `client` feature for HTTP client support with connection
pooling.

### HttpClient

`HttpClient` is the standard transport built on hyper. Construct one
of two variants: cleartext (`http://` only) or TLS-enabled
(`https://` only):

```rust
use connectrpc::client::HttpClient;

// Cleartext
let http = HttpClient::plaintext();

// TLS - requires client-tls or tls feature
let tls_config: Arc<rustls::ClientConfig> = /* trust store + ALPN */;
let http = HttpClient::with_tls(tls_config);
```

A `plaintext()` client refuses `https://` URIs and a `with_tls()`
client refuses `http://` URIs - this catches misconfiguration loudly
rather than silently downgrading.

### Connection-establishment bounds and keep-alive

Both `HttpClient` and `Http2Connection` bound connection establishment by default: a 20-second wall-clock budget on the whole DNS + TCP + TLS chain (`DEFAULT_ESTABLISHMENT_TIMEOUT`) with an additional 5-second per-address TCP bound (`DEFAULT_TCP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`). Exceeding either surfaces as `ErrorCode::Unavailable`, so a server that accepts the TCP connection but stalls the TLS handshake cannot park `poll_ready` indefinitely. To adjust or opt out, use the `builder()` entry point on either transport:

```rust
use std::time::Duration;
use connectrpc::client::Http2Connection;

let conn = Http2Connection::builder()
    .establishment_timeout(Duration::from_secs(10))
    .keep_alive_interval(Duration::from_secs(30))
    .keep_alive_while_idle(true)
    .connect_tls(uri, tls_config)
    .await?;
```

`Http2ConnectionBuilder` also proxies hyper's HTTP/2 keep-alive and flow-control knobs (`keep_alive_interval`, `keep_alive_timeout`, `keep_alive_while_idle`, `initial_stream_window_size`, `initial_connection_window_size`, `adaptive_window`), with a `TokioTimer` pre-wired so the keep-alive setters work without further plumbing. The `h2_settings(|b| ...)` escape hatch exposes the underlying hyper builder for knobs not surfaced directly. To restore the unbounded pre-0.8.0 behaviour, chain `.no_establishment_timeout().no_tcp_connect_timeout()`.

### ClientConfig

`ClientConfig` carries the base URI and per-call defaults that apply
to every RPC made with the client:

```rust
use std::time::Duration;
use connectrpc::client::ClientConfig;

let config = ClientConfig::new("http://localhost:8080".parse()?)
    .with_default_timeout(Duration::from_secs(30))
    .with_default_header("authorization", "Bearer demo-token")
    .with_default_header("x-trace-id", "trace-12345");
```

These defaults automatically apply to every call from that client.
Use them for cross-cutting concerns like auth or tracing IDs.

### CallOptions

For per-call overrides, use the `_with_options` method variants and
pass `CallOptions`:

```rust
use connectrpc::client::CallOptions;

let resp = client.greet_with_options(
    GreetRequest { name: "World".into(), ..Default::default() },
    CallOptions::default()
        .with_timeout(Duration::from_secs(5))
        .with_max_message_size(1024 * 1024),
).await?;
```

Per-call options replace config defaults for the fields they set
(timeout here); other defaults (the auth header) still apply.

### Reading the response

Unary responses give you several access patterns:

```rust
let resp = client.greet(req).await?;

// Pattern 1: borrow the view via .view(). Zero-copy. Field access
// (.greeting -> &str) works directly on the returned view, and the
// response handle keeps headers/trailers available alongside it.
println!("{}", resp.view().greeting);
let _ = resp.headers();
let _ = resp.trailers();

// Pattern 2: consume via .into_view() to get the OwnedView. Still
// zero-copy - read fields through .reborrow() - but discards
// headers/trailers.
let msg = client.greet(req).await?.into_view();
let greeting: &str = msg.reborrow().greeting;

// Pattern 3: .into_owned() for the prost-style owned struct.
// Allocates and copies all string/bytes fields.
let owned: GreetResponse = client.greet(req).await?.into_owned();

// Pattern 4: .into_owned_parts() when you need the owned struct AND
// the response metadata - the metadata-preserving form of Pattern 3.
let (headers, owned, trailers) = client.greet(req).await?.into_owned_parts();
```

### Custom transports

Generated clients are generic over `ClientTransport`, which is auto-
implemented for any `tower::Service` that handles
`http::Request<ClientBody>` and returns `http::Response<B>`. So you
can plug in any tower stack as the transport:

```rust
use tower::ServiceBuilder;
use tower_http::timeout::TimeoutLayer;
use connectrpc::client::{Http2Connection, ServiceTransport};

let conn = Http2Connection::connect_plaintext(uri).await?.shared(1024);
let stacked = ServiceBuilder::new()
    .layer(TimeoutLayer::new(Duration::from_secs(30)))
    .service(conn);

let client = GreetServiceClient::new(
    ServiceTransport::new(stacked),
    config,
);
```

This is also how the wasm example
([`examples/wasm-client/`](../examples/wasm-client)) plugs in a
browser `fetch`-based transport.

## Errors and status codes

`ConnectError` is the error type for both server-returned and
client-observed errors:

```rust
pub struct ConnectError {
    pub code: ErrorCode,
    pub message: Option<String>,
    pub details: Vec<ErrorDetail>,
    // response headers and trailers: private, exposed via the
    // response_headers()/trailers() accessors and their _mut variants
}
```

`ErrorCode` is the canonical Connect/gRPC status set:
`Canceled`, `Unknown`, `InvalidArgument`, `DeadlineExceeded`,
`NotFound`, `AlreadyExists`, `PermissionDenied`, `ResourceExhausted`,
`FailedPrecondition`, `Aborted`, `OutOfRange`, `Unimplemented`,
`Internal`, `Unavailable`, `DataLoss`, `Unauthenticated`.

Construct one with the message:

```rust
return Err(ConnectError::new(
    ErrorCode::PermissionDenied,
    format!("user {user} cannot read {name}"),
));
```

The dispatcher maps each code to the appropriate HTTP status (e.g.
`NotFound` -> 404, `Unauthenticated` -> 401, `PermissionDenied` ->
403) and the appropriate protocol-specific representation. Clients
parse it back into the same `ConnectError` shape regardless of which
protocol they're speaking.

For more structured errors, attach `ErrorDetail` entries (which carry
typed protobuf messages) before returning. These flow through to
clients in the standard Connect error-detail wire format.

## Compression

The runtime ships with gzip, zstd, and identity by default. Servers
advertise supported algorithms in the `accept-encoding` response and
honor the client's `connect-content-encoding` request header (or
`grpc-encoding` for the gRPC protocols).

### Per-RPC compression control

A handler can override the server's compression policy for a single
response via `Response::compress`:

```rust
async fn greet(
    &self,
    _ctx: RequestContext,
    req: ServiceRequest<'_, GreetRequest>,
) -> ServiceResult<GreetResponse> {
    let mut resp = Response::new(/* ... */);
    if response_is_huge() {
        resp = resp.compress(true);  // force compress this response
    }
    Ok(resp)
}
```

### Custom compression algorithms

`CompressionRegistry` is pluggable. Implement `CompressionProvider`
for your algorithm and register it on the dispatcher:

```rust
use connectrpc::{CompressionProvider, CompressionRegistry, ConnectError};
use bytes::Bytes;

struct MyCompression;

impl CompressionProvider for MyCompression {
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str { "my-algo" }

    fn compress(&self, data: &[u8]) -> Result<Bytes, ConnectError> {
        // ...
    }

    fn decompressor<'a>(
        &self,
        data: &'a [u8],
    ) -> Result<Box<dyn std::io::Read + 'a>, ConnectError> {
        // Return a reader that yields decompressed bytes. The framework
        // controls how much is read, so decompression is bounded by
        // ConnectRpcService::max_message_size.
        // ...
    }
}

let registry = CompressionRegistry::default().register(MyCompression);
let service = ConnectRpcService::new(router).with_compression(registry);
```
